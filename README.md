# Xamarin.Plugin.DRMIntegrity

The DRMIntegrity plugin for Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms applications will handle two integrity checks:

* Check if the device has root access activated (Jailbreak on iOS, root on Android)
* Check if the application bundle is signed correctly, which will give you a **hint** to piracy

There is never a 100% chance to distinguish cracked apps from others. ** Please use with care! **

## Getting Started

Coming soon.

### Supported Platforms

|Platform|Supported|Version|
| ------------------- | :-----------: | :------------------: |
|Xamarin.iOS|Yes|iOS 8+|
|Xamarin.iOS Unified|Yes|iOS 8+|
|Xamarin.Android|Yes|API 10+|

### Using the API

```csharp

/// <summary>
/// Determine whether the device might be jailbroken (iOS) respectively rooted (Android).
/// </summary>
/// <returns><c>true</c> if root access might be active, <c>false</c> otherwise.</returns>
bool IsDeviceRooted { get; }

/// <summary>
/// Determine whether the application might be cracked.
/// </summary>
/// <returns><c>true</c> if application might be cracked, <c>false</c> otherwise.</returns>
bool IsApplicationCracked { get; }

```
